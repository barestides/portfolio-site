    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a computer science student at UC. I primarily have experience with programming in Java
      and Clojure as well as experience in Linux server administration. I have been running my Minecraft
      server, <a href="https://www.arcaneminecraft.com">Arcane Survival</a>, for almost 3 years.

    </p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>So far, I have done 4 software development internships at 3 different places places: Projetech,
      Siemens PLM Software, and with Air Force Research Laboratories / Department of Defense
      Supercomputer Resource Center (AFRL/DSRC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.</p>
    <p>
      I spent two summers at AFRL/DSRC working on three separate projects. The first project was a front
      end design overhaul of an existing web application built by a previous intern. This was my
      introduction to software development in a professional environment. The second project involved
      finding a solution for a group of people to be able to share information and collaborate in a
      secure environment. The third project was rather open-ended. I experimented with Software Defined
      Networking technologies to see if it would be a worthwhile investment. This was more of a learning
      experience for me as I had previously very little networking knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Siemens PLM Software, I worked on a team to develop a "testing harness" to assist the QA team
      with writing automated tests. This involved communicating with people across the world in order to
      deliver a useful product. Throughout this co-op I improved my Java programming skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Projetech, I worked on an internal tool that would help the technical side of the company better
      manage the multitude of clients' cloud instances. During this co-op, I learned a new
      language, Clojure, and gained proficiency with Emacs and with using git for version control in a
      collaborative environment. I also did significantly more organized planning with my manager and
      fellow co-ops than I had in previous internships.
